This was made as an assignment for python concepts and methodology I, taken in fall 2020. The prompt was as follows:

Goals:

Either revise an old assignment or create a new file to include:
at least one dictionary
adding an item to the dictionary
removing an item from the dictionary
updating an item in the dictionary
